    <h1>Why did Chicago reverse the river?</h1>
    <p>
    When raw sewage and other pollutants were dumped in the river, they flowed into Chicago`s primary source of drinking water. As the city grew, fear of diseases spread, and officials decided to permanently reverse the river`s flow, sendingits polluted water <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River"> the Mississippi River </a> instead.
